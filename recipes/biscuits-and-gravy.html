    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16oz) can regrigerated jumbo buttermilk biscuits</li>
      <li>1 (9.6oz) package of sausage</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange biscuits 1 to 2 inches apart
        on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until
        golden brown, about 13 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until
        thoroughly heated, stirring frequently, about 5 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in flour until well combined. Gradually add milk, stirring
        continuously, until the gravy thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce
        heat to medium-low: simmer and stir for 2 more minutes. Season to
        taste with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Split biscuits in half. Place 2 halves on each of 8 plates:
        top with about 1/3 cup gravy.
      </li>
    </ol>
